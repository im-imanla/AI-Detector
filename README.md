# Face Detecton In Python Using OpenCV

# Steps :

       # 1.Loading HaarCascadeFace Algorithm
       
       # 2.Initializing Camera
       
       # 3.Reading Frame from Camera
       
       # 4.Converting Color image into Grayscale Image
       
       # 5.Obtaining Face coordinates by passing algorithm
       
       # 6.Drawing Rectangle on the Face Coordinates
       
       # 7.Display the output Frame

# Output :
